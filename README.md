My VimJanus "Portable"
==========

This is my Vim Janus portable, whenever you are in a Linux PC you can
just clone this repository access the folder and run the install.sh
script and that's all. A pretty good configuration for Vim because we
know that out of the box it's not very attractive.

The modifications aren't just only visual, it has Tab Autocompletion,
NerdTree, A nice smart tab, Syntax Highlight, among others. Give it a try!

To install it.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/dnetix/vimjanus.git && cd vimjanus && ./install.sh
```

Just make sure that you have installed vim and python

```Shell
sudo apt-get install vim python
```

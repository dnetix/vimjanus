My VimJanus "Portable"
==========

This is my Vim Janus portable, whenever you are in a Linux PC you can
just clone this repository access the folder and run the install.sh
script and that's all. A pretty good configuration for Vim because we
know that out of the box it's not very attractive.

To install it.

git clone https://github.com/dnetix/vimjanus.git
cd vimjanus
./install.sh

Just make sure that you have installed vim and python

sudo apt-get install vim python
